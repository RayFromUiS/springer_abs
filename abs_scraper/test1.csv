"This artistic work sets out to devise a set of critical and artistic strategies to sense the ways in which the sky is structured under a fusion of state and corporate power. By placing the military drone as a central actor, I argue the atmosphere is enveloped within a topography of enclosure, reconfigured in the service of military and corporate technologies. By using an artistic strategy of what I term counter-reconnaissance, a necessary inversion of the satellite’s gaze, we may conceive of, and value, the atmosphere as a material entity; a parallel sky that is vivid and tangible, political and aesthetic. Counter-reconnaissance utilizes the narrative terrain of Google Earth, where its open and accessible data can be used to help map the shadow states—and invisible rules—that structures and encloses space all around us. This method counter-maps global American military drone infrastructure and makes it palpable to the viewer, creating a constellation of violent geographies.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s42984-020-00024-9,Article,"Royal Academy of Art, Den Haag, The Netherlands",Donald Weber,,"Weber, D.

"This study of humanities and social science dissertations published by university presses considers revised dissertations [RD’s] and their salient characteristics. Often dissertations in the humanities and social sciences become the sine qua non for advancement in academia; therefore, it is instructive to ascertain the ecology of dissertations published by university presses. Only revised dissertations [RD’s], and English language presses were surveyed from proprietary data provided by a North American book distributor [Yankee Book Peddler, Inc.] and were triaged for bibliographic aspects as well as for intellectual coverage. Disciplinary alignment, subject specializations, geographical distribution, as well degree of interdisciplinarity, and series publication highlight findings. Library of Congress Classification further articulated disciplinary orientation. Oxford and Cambridge University Presses, but presses are specialized by subject emphases.

"As the number of medical and health humanities degree programs in the United States rapidly increases (Berry, Lamb and Jones 2016, 2017), it is especially timely to consider the range of specific disciplinary (and multidisciplinary) perspectives that might benefit students enrolled in these programs. This paper discusses the inclusion of one such perspective from the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS.) The author asserts that STS benefits students in the medical and health humanities in four particular ways, by: (1) challenging the “progress narrative” around the advancement of biomedicine as scientific practice, (2) evaluating the meaning of technology, especially in how technology orients us towards sickness and how health technology is in turn shaped by social and cultural values, (3) assessing the plurality of biomedical epistemologies, rather than assuming biomedicine is one, cohesive body of knowledge that does not differ across contexts, and (4) critiquing bias in biomedical practice and science, especially in the marginalization of women’s voices and in the racial and postcolonial trajectories of contemporary biomedicine. The paper discusses the theoretical importance of these four trajectories to the medical and health humanities, as well as the venues for inclusion of STS within coursework and programming at Case Western Reserve University. The paper also comments on how programming at other institutions might be adapted to incorporate STS scholarship. By drawing on numerous examples of research in the anthropology, sociology, history, and the philosophy of science, this article seeks to open a conversation about the value of science and technology studies to health humanities pedagogy.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10912-019-09551-3,Article,"School of Medicine, Department of Bioethics (Sears TA200), Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH, 44106, USA",Julia Knopes,,"Knopes, J.

"The characteristics of the production and dissemination of scientific activity in social sciences and humanities make such endeavours less visible than other areas in international databases. The same circumstances also limit the evaluation of journals, researchers and institutions and complicate the quality-based comparison of scientific-scholarly journals. This study presents a methodology developed in order to classify the Spanish journals of social science and humanities. With the aim of considering national journals in research activity evaluation processes, the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT) has sponsored and coordinated the development of a classification that allows journals that have obtained the FECYT Quality Seal to be ranked. For this purpose, a model with two dimensions (impact and visibility) based on quantitative criteria has been carried out. To obtain indicators in each of these dimensions, databases such as the Science Citation Index, the Social Science Citation Index, the Arts & Humanities Citation Index and the Emerging Sources Citation Index from the Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, SciELO, Google Metrics and the Information Matrix for the Analysis of Journals are used as sources of information. Spanish evaluation agencies have recently announced the implementation of this evaluation methodology in various disciplines.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-020-03665-5,Article,"INAECU Institute (Research Institute for Higher Education and Science), Carlos III University of Madrid, Calle Madrid 126, Getafe, 28903, Madrid, Spain","Daniela De Filippo,Rafael Aleixandre-Benavent,Elías Sanz-Casado",,"De Filippo, D., Aleixandre-Benavent, R. & Sanz-Casado, E.

"New sources of citation data have recently become available, such as Microsoft Academic, Dimensions, and the OpenCitations Index of CrossRef open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI). Although these have been compared to the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS), Scopus, or Google Scholar, there is no systematic evidence of their differences across subject categories. In response, this paper investigates 3,073,351 citations found by these six data sources to 2,515 English-language highly-cited documents published in 2006 from 252 subject categories, expanding and updating the largest previous study. Google Scholar found 88% of all citations, many of which were not found by the other sources, and nearly all citations found by the remaining sources (89–94%). A similar pattern held within most subject categories. Microsoft Academic is the second largest overall (60% of all citations), including 82% of Scopus citations and 86% of WoS citations. In most categories, Microsoft Academic found more citations than Scopus and WoS (182 and 223 subject categories, respectively), but had coverage gaps in some areas, such as Physics and some Humanities categories. After Scopus, Dimensions is fourth largest (54% of all citations), including 84% of Scopus citations and 88% of WoS citations. It found more citations than Scopus in 36 categories, more than WoS in 185, and displays some coverage gaps, especially in the Humanities. Following WoS, COCI is the smallest, with 28% of all citations. Google Scholar is still the most comprehensive source.

"In this study, differences between Spanish social sciences and humanities journals are examined using a quantitative approach. Firstly, using a set of 144 psychology journals and 69 philosophy journals, statistically significant differences have been identified in 11 characteristics/indicators. Secondly, a logistic regression was carried out on the dichotomous response variable “belonging to the social sciences” or “belonging to the humanities”, on 777 Spanish social sciences journals, 563 humanities journals that have been previously classified and 17 existing predictor variables. The regression model reached an overall correct classification of 78.8 %. The explanatory variables considered in the model are analyzed and interpreted taking into account the change in the odds ratio and the indication of their contribution to the correct classification rate in the two response values. Finally the average associated probability of belonging to the social sciences group is calculated for each discipline and reflected in a spectrum of the probability of belonging to the social sciences or the humanities.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-012-0838-y,Article,"Spanish National Research Council, Centre for Human and Social Sciences, Albasanz 26-28, 28037, Madrid, Spain","Jorge Mañana-Rodríguez,Elea Giménez-Toledo",,"Mañana-Rodríguez, J., Giménez-Toledo, E.

"Political discourse and policy reforms worldwide have highlighted the importance of promoting the knowledge economy by stimulating academics’ societal engagement (ASE). Such narratives partly aim at influencing academics’ attitudes and behaviors. Earlier work that has investigated such influence has tended to overlook the development in humanities and social science, and focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. This paper contributes to filling this gap. Based on the assumption that academics’ views are, to a significant extent, shaped during their early years in academia, we investigate whether there are generational differences in attitudes to ASE. Four different higher education systems, including both Napoleonic and Humboldtian models, are investigated: Germany, Sweden, Portugal, and Argentina. Our analysis of the results of the international Academic Profession in the Knowledge Society survey reveals marked country-level differences in the way academics perceive the importance of ASE activities. Overall, there is no strong evidence that the current generation of HSS academics has very different attitudes to ASE than previous generations. We do, however, find indications that post-2006 academics are more likely to consider ASE activities from an instrumental perspective.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41307-020-00218-6,Article,"International Centre for Higher Education Research, University of Kassel, Moenchebergstr. 17, 34109, Kassel, Germany","Christian Schneijderberg,Anders Broström,Teresa Cavalho,Lars Geschwind,Monica Marquina,Lars Müller,Nicolas Reznik",,"Schneijderberg, C., Broström, A., Cavalho, T.et al.

"To demonstrate the importance of Arctic studies in the humanities and social sciences, we collected data from the SSCI and A&HCI covering a period of over 100 years and focused on the number of papers published each year, the major journals, types of documents, major languages represented, authors and their countries publishing the most articles, author’s affiliations, collaboration and the major research subjects covered. The results indicate that worldwide scholars had never been absent in this field for more than one century. Countries near the Arctic, particularly in North America and the Nordic, show the most interest and have the most research results. Universities and colleges are the most important research institutions in this field. North America is the area that has conducted the largest amount of research, while some Western European countries such as Germany and France, performed with great enthusiasm research in relation with North Pole expeditions.

"We study the discrepancy between two ways of classifying publications in the social sciences and humanities (SSH): on the basis of the contents of publications and publication channels (cognitive classification) or on the basis of the organizational structure of departments, faculties etc. (organizational classification). Using data for the period 2000–2015 from 76,076 peer reviewed publications (co-)authored by SSH researchers affiliated to a Flemish university, we compare the organizational classification of the publications with a cognitive classification based on OECD Fields Of Science. In all fields except one, the cognitive discipline with the most publications is the one that most closely matches the organizational discipline, although there are substantial differences between disciplines in terms of overlap and concentration. At a higher aggregation level, we find that 73% of publications from the humanities are published in humanities publication channels, while this is only the case for 59% of publications from the social sciences. Social sciences are shown to have important links to medicine and health sciences. The spread of publications over cognitive disciplines, including non-SSH disciplines, is only partially related to the assignment of some publication channels to multiple FOS fields as well as multidisciplinary collaboration. Our study shows that it is quite common for researchers affiliated to an organizational unit to also carry out research in other domains.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-018-2775-x,Article,"Centre for R&D Monitoring (ECOOM), Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium","Raf Guns,Linda Sīle,Joshua Eykens,Frederik T.

"This paper captures the processes by which the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars redefined enduringly the logics of interaction between Prussia/Germany and France. It explains transformations of power, political imagination and social organisation that are key to understanding the ‘special’ nature of contemporary German–French relations. The paper finds that historical and international relations narratives fail to address the entire range of system-level transformations in the international order. Making use of approaches and concepts such as liminality, communitas, mimetic theory and the sacred, this paper proposes a novel, political anthropological perspective on such transformations, conceiving them as the interlocking of mimetic binds. First, I present wars and revolutions as liminal moments of collective threshold experiences. Second, I show how the liminal process functions at the international system-level. Third, I explain the challenge that the approach of liminality is posing to theories of international and systemic change. Fourth, I analyse the liminal process in Prussia and show how the said wars brought the French and the Prussians/Germans in a long-term mimetic rivalry. Finally, I argue that the proposed theoretical framework can take the research on international institutions and nationalism beyond the narratives of sociology, political science and historical studies.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41268-016-0073-x,Article,"Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom",Camil Francisc Roman,,"Roman, C.F.

"French political science has faced many obstacles. The most significant were the influence of neighboring disciplines such as law, sociology and history; the centralization of recruitment at the national level; the small number of research centers, particularly in the regions; the small number of teachers and researchers; the expatriation of young researchers to the United States and Canada; the loss of influence in certain areas, including the study of elections, the analysis of political parties and the study of public institutions; the absence of research in some sectors, including international political economy; the nature of political science journals; the small number of ‘think tanks’; the lack of international openness; the weak presence of French researchers in international congresses and the language barrier; and the absence of a true translation policy of fundamental works of Anglo-Saxon or Hispanic political science by publishing houses or university presses.

"The critique of Eurocentrism has become one of the main benchmarks for critical scholarship in International Relations (IR). Unsurprisingly, the effort to overcome Eurocentric conceptions of world history has been at the forefront of the bourgeoning subfield of International Historical Sociology (IHS). In many anti-Eurocentric theorisations of IHS, Political Marxist approaches to world history have been posited as counter-models imbued with methodological ‘internalism’ and Eurocentrism. In this article, I critically re-evaluate the extent to which IHS has remedied the problem of Eurocentrism. Furthermore, I argue that the conventional critique of Political Marxism (PM) is largely off the mark and, indeed, IHS in general and the theory of Uneven and Combined Development in particular need PM to deepen the international sociological imagination and deliver a non-hierarchical reading of world history.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41268-018-0146-0,Article,"Department of International Relations, University of Kyrenia, via Mersin 10, Turkey, 99320, Kyrenia, Cyprus",Eren Duzgun,,"Duzgun, E.

"Eurocentric approaches to political Islam tend to deploy an internalist methodology that theoretically obscures the generative and constitutive role of international relations. This article addresses this problem through a critical application of Leon Trotsky's idea of ‘uneven and combined development’ to Ayatollah Khomeini's invention of the concept of ‘Islamic government’. It argues that this concept was international in its socio-political stimulus and intellectual content, and, crucially, reflected, influenced, and mobilised an emergent liminal sociality that combined Western and Islamic socio-cultural forms. This heterogeneous character of Iran's experience of modernity is, the article argues, theoretically inaccessible to Eurocentric approaches’ homogeneous and unilinear conceptions of history, which, as a result, generate exceptionalist modes of explanations.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jird.2012.15,Article,"Department of International Relations, School of Global Studies, The University of Sussex, Brighton, BN1 9SJ, UK",Kamran Matin,,"Matin, K.

"International Relations (IR) is an Anglo-American discipline. It was founded in 1919 at Aberystwyth University. Immediately after the Second World War it found a particularly fertile ground for its development in the United States. Even if the discipline remained marked by its Anglo-American origins, a sociological school of international relations emerged in France in the 1960s, with two main authors Raymond Aron and Marcel Merle. This French sociology of international relations already dated back to the eighteenth century with Montesquieu and Tocqueville. In the context of the First and Second World Wars, Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, produced an embryonic sociology of international relations. After the Second World War, Aron’s sociology of international relations marked a break with the French school. His sociology was influenced by Max Weber and Carl von Clausewitz. He produced a comprehensive and historical tradition of international relations sociology and his analyses had a strong influence in IR specialists during the entire period of the Cold War. Today, his thought continues to exert influence on French and foreign internationalists as an essential reference point of the discipline. Marcel Merle, for his part, influenced by the work of Durkheim and Mauss, created an explanatory, positive school studying transnational relations which exerted influence on French and foreign internationalists as well. This contribution offers an historical overview of the development of this French tradition of sociology of international relations from the eighteenth century to the present time.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12108-017-9339-z,Article,"Department of Law, Jean Moulin Lyon 3 University (EA 4586 - CLESID), 15 Quai Claude Bernard, 69007, Lyon, France",Thomas Meszaros,,"Meszaros, T.

"This paper seeks to present a framework for understanding the impact of China’s rise on the established international order with a special focus on the contradictions and dilemmas facing both China and the order around it. It suggests heuristic insights from two Chinese cultural and linguistic metaphysics in order to denote the dynamic and interactive relationship between the rise of China and the existing order in terms of both opportunities and challenges. The authors argue that both China and the existing order have been going through periods of “sleeping in the same bed with different dreams”, and now they are in the stage of “riding tiger” in which both sides face dilemmas in their complicated and complex relationship. The paper concludes that the rise of China and the existing order will continue to be intertwined in a dialectic of waxing and waning, and flux and reflux. In order for each to find a regional and global role which the other will accept and support both sides will have to go through a considerable period of struggle, tension and adjustment.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11366-013-9276-9,Article,"Research Center on Development and International Relations, Department of Culture and Global Studies, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark","Xing Li,Timothy M.

"In this paper we discuss how an innovative audio-visual project was adopted to foster active, rather than declarative learning, in critical International Relations (IR). First, we explore the aesthetic turn in IR, to contrast this with forms of representation that have dominated IR scholarship. Second, we describe how students were asked to record short audio or video projects to explore their own insights through aesthetic and non-written formats. Third, we explain how these projects are understood to be deeply embedded in social science methodologies. We cite our inspiration from applying a personal sociological imagination, as a way to counterbalance a ‘marketised’ slant in higher education, in a global economy where students are often encouraged to consume, rather than produce knowledge. Finally, we draw conclusions in terms of deeper forms of student engagement leading to new ways of thinking and presenting new skills and new connections between theory and practice.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/eps.2016.21,Article,"Politics and International Relations, School of Languages and Social Sciences, Aston University, Aston Triangle, Birmingham, B4 7ET, UK","jelena obradovic-wochnik,sarah hayes",,"obradovic-wochnik, j., hayes, s. re-visualising international relations: audio-visual projects and direct encounters with the political in security studies.Eur Polit Sci 16, 415–429 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1057/eps.2016.21",Political Science and International Relations,https://doi.org/10.1057/eps.2016.21,2017,European Political Science,"Eur Polit Sci 16, 415–429 (2017)","teaching,critical security studies,audio-visual assessments,sociological imagination",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/eps.2016.21.pdf,2017-09-18,,re-visualising international relations: audio-visual projects and direct encounters with the political in security studies,16
"China’s growing influence on the world has generated profound effects on the political and economic decisions of her partner nations. Recent conflict escalation between China and western countries gives rise to widespread concern over the possibility of delinking China from global trade and supply chain. By drawing on utility theory, we suggest that the political relationship is a key determinant of collective emotions of consumers and trading companies and consequently the interactions between importers and exporters. We hypothesize that warmer relations lead to larger increases (or smaller decreases) in trade while cooler relations have the opposite effect. Based on monthly data of China and her twelve trading partners from 1981 to 2019, our study provides an empirical investigation into the association between political relationship and bilateral trade flows. Our results show that shocks to relations are highly persistent and frequently cause changes in trade. However, relations themselves are little influenced by changes in trade, changes that show little persistence. We also address the US-China trade war and the observation that innovations to China’s exports to the US improve China’s relations with the US while shocks to American exports to China worsen relations from China’s perspective.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41072-020-00076-w,Article,"Department of Economics, Lingnan University, Hong Kong, China","Gregory Whitten,Xiaoyi Dai,Simon Fan,Yu Pang",,"Whitten, G., Dai, X., Fan, S.et al.

"The conventional view of the discipline of international relations (IR) as an ‘American social science’ leaves little room for national traditions of international relations theorizing. We challenge this view by constructing and applying a theoretical model conceptualizing the relationship between societal and scientific developments and the construction of national IR disciplines. Taking our point of departure in this model, we map the gradual development of the study of international relations as an academic discipline in Denmark and explain how the form and content of the Danish discipline continue to reflect important traits of that country's political culture. We argue that the effect of political culture is subject to structural constraints set by geopolitics, market size and global theoretical trends. In accordance with this view, the American influence on the discipline is seen as a structural constraint defining the boundaries of the discipline and serving as a major source of global theoretical trends.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jird.1800031,Article,"Danish Institute for International Studies, Strandgade 56, Copenhagen K, DK-1401, Denmark","Henrik Ø Breitenbauch,Anders Wivel",,"Breitenbauch, H., Wivel, A.

"Anarchy is one of the most important concepts in international theory; Thomas Hobbes is regularly invoked to illustrate the character and the consequences of anarchy. This article interrogates the theological aspect of Hobbes’ political philosophy in a bid to move beyond the distorting mythology that has grown up around ‘Hobbesian’ international relations. In doing so, it advances a positive argument that presents Hobbes as a theorist of interstate society that is made and unmade in the way that God made the universe. The concept of anarchy that is attributed to Hobbes is rooted in a theological dispute about the nature of God and the extent of his power, which entails a particular way of constituting and comprehending reality. When the implications of this dispute are taken into account, it becomes evident that anarchy is neither an objective feature of a world composed of independent states nor an inescapable logical condition that follows the absence of central authority. Rather, anarchy is an achievement of thought, born of a particular time and place, which seeks a reflection of itself in the mirror of eternity.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41268-017-0117-x,Article,"Department of Political Science, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, National University of Singapore, AS1 04-43, 11 Arts Link, Singapore, 117570, Singapore",William Bain,,"Bain, W.

"Politics and International Relations (IR) tend to be discussed as separate disciplines. Rather than emphasising their shared divisions and methodological differences, dominant narratives separate the two, but these narratives also serve to reinforce and legitimate (to slightly differing degrees) the dominance of American positivism. As such, it is argued that if we are to understand the contemporary state of both disciplines, it is useful to reflect on their historical development. The aim of this article is (briefly) to map critically the development of Politics and IR as disciplines that, while having differing historical beginnings, have developed as parallel rather than integrated disciplines facing similar internal epistemological, methodological and cultural divisions. It is noted, however, that their parallel development is uneven, with challenges to the mainstream coming far earlier in IR than Politics, and as such opening the way for much greater acceptance of the notion of methodological pluralism in contemporary IR (outside the US) than in the study of Politics. Further, it is argued that the writing of histories of the disciplines thus far have served to legitimate and reinforce dominant Western conceptions of IR and Politics both descriptively and normatively.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/eps.2010.39,Article,"School of Political Social and International Studies, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7PN, UK",Heather Savigny,,"Savigny, H.

"Since the launch of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) the field of materials informatics (MI) emerged to remove the bottlenecks limiting the pathway towards rapid materials discovery. Although the machine learning (ML) and optimization techniques underlying MI were developed well over a decade ago, programs such as the MGI encouraged researchers to make the technical advancements that make these tools suitable for the unique challenges in materials science and engineering. Overall, MI has seen a remarkable rate in adoption over the past decade. However, for the continued growth of MI, the educational challenges associated with applying data science techniques to analyse materials science and engineering problems must be addressed. In this paper, we will discuss the growing use of materials informatics in academia and industry, highlight the need for educational advances in materials informatics, and discuss the implementation of a materials informatics course into the curriculum to jump-start interested students with the skills required to succeed in materials informatics projects.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557/adv.2020.171,Article,"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, North Carolina State University, 911 Partners Way, Raleigh, NC, 27695-7907, USA","Thomas J.

"Due to the decline of the Analytical Philosophy of Science empirical disciplines may be treated not only as the objects but also as the means of metascientific reflection. The paper investigates to what extent and in what way this general idea of 'science self-applied' put forward by Quine manifests itself with respect to generative linguistics. Firstly, it is shown that the 'self-application' of the modularity hypothesis, which is the basic assumption of generative linguistics, yields the central thesis of a modular philosophy of science which may provide us with powerful means in tackling central problems of the philosophy of science. Secondly, the workability of the framework thus obtained is exemplified by applying it to generative linguistics itself. The analysis proves that the specific properties of two types of explanation in generative grammar can be traced back to the parametrization relation between the universal principles of the 'conceptual' and the 'motivational' module of behaviour.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1009638227259,Article,"Department of German Linguistics, Lajos Kossuth University, Pf. 47, H-4010, Debrecen, Hungary",András Kertész,,"Kertész, A.

"In addition to student assessment, curriculum assessment is a critical element to any pedagogy. It helps the educator assess the teaching of concepts, determine what may be lacking, and make changes for continual improvement. Meaningful assessment can be complicated when disciplines converge or when new approaches are implemented. To facilitate this, we present a network-based visualization schema to represent a materials informatics curriculum that combines materials science and data science concepts. We analyze the curriculum using network representations and relevant concepts from graph theory. This reveals established connections, linkages between materials science and data science, and the extent to which different concepts are connected. We also describe how some materials science topics are introduced from a data perspective, and present an illustrative case study from the curriculum.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557/adv.2020.32,Article,"Department of Materials Design and Innovation, The University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA","Erik Einarsson,Olga Wodo,Prathima C.

"We report here our experiences from using easily acquired web-cam components for collaborative ventures in the Earth sciences. We have used a variety of hardware and different software. We demonstrate from various locations in the U.S.A. the feasibility of using web-cam in multitudinous activities, relevant for conducting research and knowledge dissemination. We summarize the quality of the connections from the various combinations of communicating parties. Today, web-cams can be utilized as an economical and viable means of point-to-point communication in the Earth science community. Greater bandwidth is sorely needed for activities such as multi-party conferencing on the present internet network. We propose that web-cam can be readily deployed as a web-service for facilitating collaborative research over the GRID infrastructure, using the middleware Narada-Brokering.

"Environmental exposure to chemicals associated with modern industrial and agricultural practices is a major societal concern. Evaluating and managing risk from these chemicals requires knowledge based on both the natural and the social sciences. In this study, we investigated if students studying in environmental programs are acquiring the technical expertise, or focused preparation in risk sciences, to actively participate in risk assessment. Among programs with faculty associated with the Association of Environmental Studies and Sciences, we found that comprehensive preparatory coursework directed toward risk assessment was not a common feature among most programs. Preparation in statistics was evident among all degree programs, and those programs awarding Bachelor of Science degrees generally required foundational coursework in the natural sciences. Required coursework was rarely directly related to the risk sciences or toxicology. As a group, program graduates would not have acquired through their environmental program foundations central to the risk assessment processes. However, as shown in the analysis presented here, sufficient variation exists both among and within programs to anticipate that many individual graduates could have this preparation and make active contributions.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13412-015-0331-z,Article,"Department of Public Health Sciences, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, 9201 University City Blvd., Charlotte, 28223, NC, USA","Gary S.

"The main goal of this study was to examine the Environmental Workshop unit taught to Environmental Sciences majors in the high schools in Israel and learn if, and in what ways, this unit could become a model for environmental education throughout the high school curriculum. We studied the special characteristics of the Environmental Workshop (EW) unit, which is based on inquiry-based learning that takes place in and out of school, and includes an environmental action component as well. We describe three approaches to the EW we identified. After identifying teachers’ challenges in assessing their students, in addition to the phenomenographic study, we suggest and demonstrate assessing the EW students by relevant socio-scientific issues. Finally, we argue that the EW could be incorporated in the junior as well as the high school curriculum as a coherent unit that is in line with environmental education in its broader sense.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-012-9327-9,Article,"Department of Education in Technology and Science, Technion—Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, 32000, Israel","Tali Tal,Anat Abramovitch",,"Tal, T., Abramovitch, A.

From a conceptual point of view, business processes have proven to be ideal design items in conjunction with the use of graphical methods and tools. Especially for network design and implementation, business process modelling serves as the fundamental starting point. However, existing tools for Business Process Management do not provide support for Virtual Enterprise network design and implementation sufficiently.

"Despite the great importance of designing innovative business models, a validated methodology that helps related process is still not available. To fill this gap, this research introduces business model management concepts that consider business models as individual entities that can be systematically developed and managed by utilizing science based methodology. This study mainly focuses on proposing business model evaluation and deployment framework by applying analytic network process (ANP), a multi multiple criteria decision-making method and portfolio matrix strategy. The proposed evaluation method is designed to consider both internal and external perspectives where internal perspective is measured through ANP method by employees, while external perspective is measured through customer survey by in-depth interview. The obtained values from ANP and customer survey are then used to construct the business model portfolio matrix for continuous business model management. To this end, this study identifies 12 criteria within three different categories employed in ANP analysis and business model portfolio matrix, respectively. The proposed framework for managing business models provides new insights to both practitioners and academics. It regards business models as individual entities and introduces a way to practically apply the business model concept. It also provides managers with guidelines to manage business model alternatives in terms of evaluation, selection, and continuous management. Finally, because this study is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first attempts to employ the portfolio management concept in business model research, it can function as the foundation for future applied business model research.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-020-00427-2,Article,"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology College of Business, Seoul, South Korea","Kwanyoung Im,Kihwan Nam,Hyunbo Cho",,"Im, K., Nam, K. & Cho, H.

"In this article, we philosophically reflect on the nature of business management. We move beyond the political paradigm of the conceptualization of management in order to lay the ground for a philosophy of business management. First, we open-up the self-evident conceptualization of business management in contemporary management practices by comparing ancient and contemporary definitions of management.

"We calculate the energy density of high energy phonons created from a pulse of low energy phonons spatially confined to a narrow cone. We include the tangential expansion of the propagating pulse and the interactions between high energy phonons within the pulse as well with low energy phonons. The expansion of the pulse causes it to cool so much that the creation of high energy phonons stops within ≈3 mm of the heater. The decay rate of high energy phonons governs the dynamic equilibrium inside the pulse. The magnitude of the high energy phonons, emitted by the pulse into the cold liquid helium, is calculated for different length pulses. It is found that small heaters can produce short pulses of high energy phonons from relatively long injected pulses.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1013783621537,Article,"School of Physics, University of Exeter, Exeter, EX4 4QL, UK","A.
